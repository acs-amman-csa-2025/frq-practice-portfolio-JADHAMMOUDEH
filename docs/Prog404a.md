## Problem statement and definition

Read a list of numbers from an external file.  Place the positive numbers into an array and the negative numbers into a different array. Display the numbers in both of them in table form

## Things I did or review to prepare for this problem

I reviewed how to read through data sets using a Scanner and how to store them in an array. I also reviewed how to use a while loop because I havent used one in a while.
## Problems I faced doing this problem

I had trouble with the for loops and trying to get the actual lengths of both array's. For example when I was actually transporting the values in I realized that if i go off by one counter then the values would get missed and there would be some gaps in the list. Another problem I ran into was with mismanaging my local counter variables and incrementing wrong variables.
## Things I learned doing this problem

I learned how to put all values in a data set into one big array and then sort that array into two small arrays using conditionals and for loops.
