## Things I did or review to prepare for this problem

We didnt really review anything, this is because we walked through this problem with Mr.Griswold.
## Problems I faced doing this problem

No problems were faced because as I mentioned before we did this with Mr.Griswold

## Things I learned doing this problem

We learnt a major new way to create lists without having to initilize a certian length to the list and we do this by creating array lists. An array lit is better than a regular list because java does the counting for you and you can store as many values in it.
